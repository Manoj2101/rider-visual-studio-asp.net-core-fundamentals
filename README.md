# ASP.NET Core 2.0 with Rider 2018.2 and Visual Studio 2017

This document compares a developer's experience with an ASP.NET Core 2.0 application in two development environments: JetBrains Rider and Microsoft Visual Studio. For the purposes of providing an all-around, detailed comparison, the document walks through the various coding demos available in Scott Allen's [ASP.NET Core Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspdotnet-core-fundamentals/table-of-contents) course (as of November 9, 2017) on Pluralsight.

The steps outlined were taken in Visual Studio 2017 15.7.4 (RTM) and various Rider 2018.2 pre-release builds.

<h2>Creating a new ASP.NET Core Web Application with C# (Empty template)</h2>

<h3>Observations: Rider</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In <em>New Solution</em> wizard, can't select a directory with the updated <em>Open File</em> dialog; have to
        enter path to parent directory manually in <em>Solution directory</em> text box; no recent directories
        available:<br><img src="images/new_solution_select_folder.png">
    </li>
    <li>Multimonitor support: Rider opened on display 1, <em>New Solution</em> wizard opened on display 2, then <em>Select
        Solution Directory</em> (<em>Open File</em>) opened on display 1 again
    </li>
    <li>Initial IDE layout:
        <ol>
            <li><em>Solution Explorer</em>'s solution node is collapsed (suboptimal),</li>
            <li><em>Scratches and Consoles</em> node is visible (suboptimal, doesn't relate to the created project);
            </li>
            <li>Text editor area is empty, contains generic keymap hints<br><img
                    src="images/solution_created_rider.png">
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Observations: Visual Studio</h3>
<ol>
    <li><em>Solution Explorer</em>:
        <ol>
            <li>Expanded to file level (good)</li>
            <li>Text editor area contains ASP.NET Code specific overview page with documentation links; <em>Connected
                Services</em> and <em>Publish</em> panes are available for navigation<br><img
                    src="images/solution_created_visual_studio.png"
                    >
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Multimonitor support: all UI related to creating a project is opened on a single display</li>
</ol>
