This document compares a developer's experience with an ASP.NET Core 2.0 application in two development environments: JetBrains Rider and Microsoft Visual Studio. For the purposes of providing an all-around, detailed comparison, the document walks through the various coding demos available in Scott Allen's [ASP.NET Core Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspdotnet-core-fundamentals/table-of-contents) course (as of November 9, 2017) on Pluralsight.

The steps outlined were taken in Visual Studio 2017 15.7.4 (RTM) and various Rider 2018.2 pre-release builds.
